## Work Experience

### AI Research Engineer

**[Aria Studios Co. Ltd](https://showaria.com/)** | **March 2024 - Present**

- **LG Ground 220**: Developed the AI backend for MusicStudio and DJingStudio, featuring lyrics generation from user input, cover image creation, and music generation using OpenAI, StabilityAI, and MixAudio APIs.
- **GPT Fine-tuning**: Fine-tuned the GPT-3.5-turbo model on conversation data of a virtual character to build a custom API for the virtual assistant. Performed several data augmentations using the OpenAI API for paraphrasing conversations.
- **LLMs Deployment**: Deployed a lightweight Phi-3 model for emotion detection from text on GCP using FastAPI and prepared a deployment container. The main objective was to detect users' emotions while interacting with a virtual character and responding accordingly.
- **VLMs Deployment**: Developed an "eye" for a virtual character to see and understand its surroundings, enabling it to interact with users. Deployed the Phi-3-Vision model on GCP for this purpose.
- **Face Parsing**: To improve face swapping performance, employed a Face Parsing model to segment the face. Enhanced model performance by modifying the feature extractor (backbone). Implementation can be found [here](https://github.com/yakhyo/face-parsing).
- **Image enhancement & Face restoration & DeepFake**: Worked on image enhancement and face restoration to improve DeepFakes. Created a DeepFake video for KBS election process coverage. Can be seen [here](https://www.youtube.com/live/CGbvG8S7HHo?si=8j4R4-f5ICfz01GF).

### ML Engineer

**[Pyler Co. Ltd](https://www.pyler.tech/)** | **July 2022 - September 2023**

- **Video-based Visual Content Moderation**: Built a Video Moderation Pipeline to flag inappropriate video content using video recognition models, achieving over a 10% improvement in model accuracy.
- **Detection-based Visual Content Moderation**: Utilized segmentation and detection techniques to precisely detect unsuitable content for brand safety. Implemented state-of-the-art models in terms of real-time speed and efficiency, improving model precision and recall by around 15% through active learning techniques. Built an end-to-end pipeline on Kubeflow for training and deployment.
- **Classification-based Visual Content Moderation**: Leveraged multi-label and multi-head classification techniques to improve precision by approximately 20% using self-supervised and supervised training approaches. This novel approach showcases the adaptability and efficacy of the model for hard samples. Prepared Docker images for each development and deployment environment (containerization).

### AI Research Engineer

**[D-Meta Co. Ltd](https://www.d-meta.ai/)** | **November 2020 - July 2022**

- **Slab Text Recognition**: Developed and designed a text detection and recognition model to efficiently recognize handwritten texts on slab metals using Spatial Transformer Networks and Sequential modeling. Built a complete pipeline from data pre-processing to training and evaluation of the model. Achieved over 90% accuracy by integrating state-of-the-art detection and recognition models for scene text images.
- **Automatic Number Plate Recognition**: Designed and developed an ANPR model to accurately detect and recognize number plates. Leveraged active learning and synthetic image generation techniques to improve precision and recall by around 15%.
- **Car Damage Detection**: Built a lightweight damage detection model and deployed it on an Android device using TorchScript. Improved the precision of the model by around 10% by tuning the model parameters.

## Research Experience

### Research Assistant

**AI and SC Lab** | **Sep 2018 - Nov 2020**

- **Computer Vision based Fire and Smoke Detection**: Designed and implemented a dilated CNN architecture for improved feature extraction and recognition in images/videos.
